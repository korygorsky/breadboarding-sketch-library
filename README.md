# Breadboarding UI Sketch Library

This concept of breadboarding for the UI was developed by [Ryan Singer](https://www.feltpresence.com) from [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). For more information on how it works, check out [this section](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding) of his book [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup). Better yet, read the whole thing. It's pure (FREE) gold.

I have no affiliation with Ryan Singer and I developed this Sketch Library after reading about his concept [here](https://www.feltpresence.com/breadboards.html), I've updated the library since reading Shape Up.

*Font Requirement*: Please note that this library uses Apple's SF Compant font which can be downloaded for free from [here](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).
